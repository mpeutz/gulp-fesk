# gulp-fesk

Fesk (**F**ront **E**nd **S**tarter **K**it) focusing on an integrated styleguide. The styleguide is based on KSS ([Knyle Style Sheets](http://warpspire.com/kss/)). KSS a documentation syntax for stylesheets is an awesome tool but lacked some features that a living styleguide needs. Fesk takes the format that KSS started and expands on it. It includes "browser compatibility", "notes", "preproccessor mixin, function and variable documentation", "color chips" and ~~"animations"~~. Furthermore Fesk has implemented a change log, stylesheet statistics dashboard, and ~~versioning~~.

This plugin currently lacks tests.
